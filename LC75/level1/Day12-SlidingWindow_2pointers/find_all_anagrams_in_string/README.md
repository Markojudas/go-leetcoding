# Find All Anagrams in a String

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters f a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.<br>
<br>

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong>         s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
<strong>Output:</strong>        [0, 6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".</code></pre>
